Hi! I am Sandra Elsa Sanjai, a Master's student in Physics of Data at the University of Padua. My interests tend to converge onto **complex dynamical systems**, where I am specifically interested in exploring epidemiological and climate forecasting. Below is a selection of projects, both major and minor, that have influenced my growth and shaped my interests. Feel free to reach out using the provided contact information.

## Major Projects

These projects involve improving upon existing models or methods through innovative approaches, often yielding strong empirical results.

- [OOD Robustness of Inpainting Models](https://github.com/Sandra-Es/Diffusion_Inpainting_OOD): Benchmarked SoTA inpainting models across multiple corruption axes; generally trained diffusion models were most robust, with +28% performance under semantic shuffling.

-  [TD-VAE](https://github.com/Sandra-Es/TD_VAE_NNDL):  (TBD)


## Minor Projects

These projects are intended to help me become comfortable with a concept or tool; the emphasis is on hands-on understanding rather than benchmark-oriented performance.
